	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>If you are lucky enough to catch me during my free time, I will talk about anything with you for ages. From interesting foods, unique travel destinations, latest fashion trends, or detailed life events, the topics I would talk about are endless. No matter what, I am always seizing opportunities to expand my knowledge on ideas and discoveries! As a result, I took this gem of mine to study a field that most resembled a continuation of my learning. I believe that computer science’s diverse pool of disciplines, ranging from graphics to distributed systems, offers a multitude of ways for me to grow.

	I’m applying this curiosity to Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. I’m a sophomore studying Computer Science with a concentration in Business. Throughout college, I have been involved with various activities and organization. I am a committee member for Aggie Miracle where I raise funds and awareness about kids in the Children's Miracle Network. I am in the Zachry Leadership Program within the Department of Engineering where I delve deep into my self awareness and the integration of the free enterprise system to develop a stronger sense of holistic leadership. I also am a director at TAMUhack, my school's largest hackathon of more than 800+ attendees.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	In the summer of 2018, I have been at Facebook as an FBU Engineering intern. I worked alongside two other interns and a Software Engineering manager to create an iOS application. The next summer, I worked as a Software Engineering intern where I utilized machine learning and core infrastructure knowledge to downrank bad ad content in Facebook's ecosystem.
